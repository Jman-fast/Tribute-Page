# Tribute page for Dr. Homi J. Bhabha

This is a personal project and my first attempt at Web development.

It utilizes HTML and CSS in two separate files. 

To run, they need to be downloaded along with an image file (hjb.jpg) and all put in the same folder, followed by running just the HTML file.
